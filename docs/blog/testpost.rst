Now what? Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

Tell them I hate them. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! You mean while I'm sleeping in it? __Ummmâ€¦to eBay?__ *No!* The cat shelter's on to me.

That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?

Large bet on myself in round one. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.

1. But I've never been to the moon!
2. You're going to do his laundry?
3. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!
